Building a data warehouse with postgresql to facilitate data analytics 

ðŸ“Š Data Analytics Pipeline with PostgreSQL & Python

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project displays an end to end data analytics project, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights using Python and PostgreSQL. The pipeline:

Loads data from two datasets: source_crm and source_erp.

Stores raw data in the Bronze schema.

Cleans and processes the data, moving it to the Silver schema.

Creates optimized analytical views in the Gold schema.

ðŸ”— Understanding the Medallion Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Schema, a layered approach to data organization that improves data quality, performance, and accessibility. The three layers are:

ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Schema (Raw Data Storage)

Stores unprocessed data directly from source_crm and source_erp.

Acts as a landing zone for all incoming data.

Data remains in its original format, including duplicates and inconsistencies.

ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Schema (Cleaned & Processed Data)

Data is transformed, deduplicated, and standardized.

Ensures consistent naming conventions and corrects errors.

Acts as an intermediate layer for structured querying.

ðŸ¥‡ Gold Schema (Optimized for Analytics)

Stores business-ready data in an easy-to-query format.

Creates aggregated views for reporting and analytics.

Enables faster insights and decision-making.
